# Thesis-Roman-Daily-Life
This repository contains the raw data and R script used for the thesis project ´´Daily life in the Roman Republican countryside´´ by F. Verhagen (2024), Uppsala University. The manuscript can be downloaded here: https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=2883&pid=diva2%3A1849132&c=41&searchType=LIST_COMING&language=en&query=&af=%5B%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=all  

The data originates from or is an elaboration of the Pontine Region Project (PRP) database. Large parts of this database will in the future also be available through the Roman Hinterland Project.

The dataset includes data from two case study areas
  1. Pontine coast between Astura, Antium and Satricum. Survey data from the Astura 2003 and Nettuno 2004, 2008 and 2012 surveys. Datasets have been published in:
     Attema, P.A.J., Feiken, H., de Haas, T.C.A. & G.W. Tol, 2008. The Astura and Nettuno surveys of the Pontine Region Project (2003–2005), Palaeohistoria, vol. 49–50, 416–516.

  2. The Pontine inner plain. Survey data from the Pontinia 2007 and Minor Centres 2012, 2013 and 2014 surveys. Datasets have been / will be published in:
     Tol, G., de Haas, T. & P. Attema (eds), forthcoming. Between Urban and Rural: the role of minor centres in the economies of Roman Italy. Volume 1: synthesis.
     De Haas, T. & G. Tol (eds), forthcoming. Between Urban and Rural: the role of minor centres in the economies of Roman Italy. Volume 2: field data.

For each case study, two datasets with the raw ceramic classifications are available: 1) the functional classification (Findclasses table in PRP database) and 2) form classification (Artefacts table in PRP database). The functional classification is methodologically not completely comparable. Therefore, the functional dataset for the coastal area needs to be re-classified to be comparable to the plain datasets. To do so, an R-script is provided. Overview tables summarizing the functional and form data are available in chapters 7 and 8 of Verhagen 2024. 

The fabric classification of the cooking wares from the Pontine region contains information about the macroscopic fabric groups, firing environment of individual sherds and the thin-section fabric classification. Extensive fabric descriptions and photos can be found in Appendix III and Appendix IV of Verhagen 2024.
